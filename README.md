## Abstract

Biomaterial surface topographies play a crucial role in influencing microbe-material interactions, with specific surfaces essential for microbial attachment. The choice of materials is pivotal, with active materials potentially leading to fatal autoimmune responses, prompting a shift towards bio-compatible, non-active materials. The microstructure of these materials can, however, be designed to modulate microbial attachment. With the conventional design process being costly and time-consuming, this study delves into the generative potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a solution.

By training GANs on existing attachment interaction data, this research seeks to expedite the biomaterial design process, generating structures with controlled behavior. The study employs three generative models: cGAN, DCGAN, and VAE, with the latter serving as a reference model. Preliminary results showcase the DCGAN model's superiority in generating 2D surface topography images, though a conclusive quality assessment of generated images remains elusive due to the nature of the input images.

This work underscores the need for adaptive feedback loops in GAN-based modeling for real-world applications and paves the way for more nuanced and efficient biomaterial design processes, with vast implications for healthcare and research.

## Introduction

The effect of material surface topography of biological implants relates to the microbe-material surface interaction, where microbes require specific surface types to attach to material surfaces. Generally, using active materials may result in the body rejecting the material due to autoimmune response, which can be fatal in some scenarios. This necessitates the use of chemically non-active, bio-compatible materials that do not lead to autoimmune responses.

However, the material surface microstructure can be used to modulate microbe attachment to the surface. Various research has shown successful modulation of microbe attachment with biomaterial surfaces by changing the shape of 3D microstructures on the surface. Multiple factors affect this interaction, including but not limited to shape, orientation, spacing, and stiffness of the microstructure.

Researching and studying such complex factors and their impacts tends to be expensive and time-consuming. Machine Learning models have proven useful in finding relationships between microbe-material surface interactions. With advancements in machine learning, the potential to accelerate this development process emerges through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which offer promising avenues for innovative design generation.

## Discussion

### Model Performance Interpretation

The superior performance of DCGAN can be attributed to several architectural advantages:
